Does a marginal tiny bit more than just display hello world, but not much more.  

Since the course is switching to a Java focus it may be a while before anything more interesting goes in the parent folder.

SDK comes with a google of files (forgive the pun) so only the main two are here, they are:

XML file local location:
... AndroidStudioProjects\HelloWorld\app\src\main\res\layout

... AndroidStudioProjects\HelloWorld\app\src\main\java\com\example\helloworld
